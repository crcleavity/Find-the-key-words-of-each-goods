How can I get the distinct words of each goods?
There are mainly two groups of words in the reviews
One kind of them is the similar words like I You He somthinglike this which is not very important
The other kind of words is out target words.
These words are meaningful to improve our products, basicly some words about the features

So what we can do here, is seperate each reviews and get each words, and delete the first group words.

In order to get the first group words, we need different type of goods, to using it as a set.

And delete them from out total words.
